- get anki sync to work by just enabling the button? How do I determine if 
  I'm in Electron...?

- test everything in the desktop app and make sure it works properly

- get updates system to work

    This is part of: 

        /Users/burton/projects/polar-app/packages/polar-bookshelf/web/js/updates/Updates.ts
    
    and UpdatesController but we don't need that part yet. 
   
- disable the external nav system
